<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — researcher and planner will use CONTEXT.md to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**How it works:**
1. Load prior context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, prior CONTEXT.md files)
2. Scout codebase for reusable assets and patterns
3. Analyze phase — skip gray areas already decided in prior phases
4. Present remaining gray areas — user selects which to discuss
5. Deep-dive each selected area until satisfied
6. Record the phase context with decisions that guide research and planning

**Output:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` — decisions clear enough that downstream agents can act without asking the user again
</objective>

<execution_context>
Workflow files are loaded on-demand in the <process> section below — not upfront.
Do not pre-load any workflow files before reading the mode routing instructions.
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op` and roadmap/state tool calls.
</context>

<process>
**Mode routing:**
```bash
CAIRN_GSD="${CAIRN_GSD:-}"; if [ ! -x "$CAIRN_GSD" ]; then _cg_try=""; for _cg_root in "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-}" "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)" "$PWD"; do [ -n "$_cg_root" ] || continue; _cg_try="$_cg_root/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh"; if [ -x "$_cg_try" ]; then CAIRN_GSD="$_cg_try"; break; fi; done; fi; if [ ! -x "${CAIRN_GSD:-}" ]; then echo "ERROR: cairn-gsd.sh not found (last path tried: ${_cg_try:-<none>}) - this workflow speaks to the cairn dispatcher that lives in the repo. Run it from inside the CairnGo checkout, or export CAIRN_GSD=<checkout>/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh" >&2; exit 1; fi; export CAIRN_GSD; gsd_run() { "$CAIRN_GSD" "$@"; }
DISCUSS_MODE=$(gsd_run query config-get workflow.discuss_mode 2>/dev/null || echo "discuss")
```

If `--assumptions` is in $ARGUMENTS:
Read and execute `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/list-phase-assumptions.md` end-to-end.
Stop here.

Otherwise, if `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"assumptions"`:
Read and execute `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/discuss-phase-assumptions.md` end-to-end.

Otherwise (`"discuss"` / unset / any other value):
Read and execute `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/discuss-phase.md` end-to-end.

**MANDATORY:** Read the appropriate workflow file BEFORE taking any action. The objective and success_criteria sections in this command file are summaries — the workflow file contains the complete step-by-step process with all required behaviors, config checks, and interaction patterns. Do not improvise from the summary.

**Lazy loading:** `templates/context.md` is loaded inside the `record_context` step of the active workflow. `discuss-phase-power.md` is loaded inside `discuss-phase.md` when `--power` is detected. Do not load either here.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Prior context loaded and applied (no re-asking decided questions)
- Gray areas identified through intelligent analysis
- User chose which areas to discuss
- Each selected area explored until satisfied
- Scope creep redirected to deferred ideas
- CONTEXT.md captures decisions, not vague vision
- User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
