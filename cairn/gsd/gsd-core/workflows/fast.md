<purpose>
Execute a trivial task inline without subagent overhead. No PLAN.md, no Task spawning,
no research, no plan checking. Just: understand → do → commit → log.

For tasks like: fix a typo, update a config value, add a missing import, rename a
variable, commit uncommitted work, add a .gitignore entry, bump a version number.

Use /gsd:quick for anything that needs multi-step planning or research.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="parse_task">
Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the task description.

If empty, ask:
```
What's the quick fix? (one sentence)
```

Store as `$TASK`.
</step>

<step name="scope_check">
**Before doing anything, verify this is actually trivial.**

A task is trivial if it can be completed in:
- ≤ 3 file edits
- ≤ 1 minute of work
- No new dependencies or architecture changes
- No research needed

If the task seems non-trivial (multi-file refactor, new feature, needs research),
say:

```
This looks like it needs planning. Use /gsd:quick instead:
  /gsd:quick "{task description}"
```

And stop.
</step>

<step name="execute_inline">
Do the work directly:

1. Read the relevant file(s)
2. Make the change(s)
3. Verify the change works (run existing tests if applicable, or do a quick sanity check)

**No PLAN.md.** Just do it.
</step>

<step name="commit">
Commit the change atomically:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: {concise description of what changed}"
```

Use conventional commit format: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` as appropriate.
</step>

<step name="log_to_state">
Record the completed quick task as a FACT, with the schema-backed
`quick-tasks-append` verb (#2133, ADR-2143 §3/§7). The call is
UNCONDITIONAL: the binary owns the question of whether the fact can be
recorded and answers it with an exit code, so nothing is read to decide
whether to call it. When the append cannot be made, the verb fails loud
(non-zero exit) naming the reason instead of silently guessing a column
count — the `awk NF-2` arithmetic that was the root cause of #2133.

```bash
CAIRN_GSD="${CAIRN_GSD:-}"; if [ ! -x "$CAIRN_GSD" ]; then _cg_try=""; for _cg_root in "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-}" "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)" "$PWD"; do [ -n "$_cg_root" ] || continue; _cg_try="$_cg_root/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh"; if [ -x "$_cg_try" ]; then CAIRN_GSD="$_cg_try"; break; fi; done; fi; if [ ! -x "${CAIRN_GSD:-}" ]; then echo "ERROR: cairn-gsd.sh not found (last path tried: ${_cg_try:-<none>}) - this workflow speaks to the cairn dispatcher that lives in the repo. Run it from inside the CairnGo checkout, or export CAIRN_GSD=<checkout>/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh" >&2; exit 1; fi; export CAIRN_GSD; gsd_run() { "$CAIRN_GSD" "$@"; }
gsd_run quick-tasks-append --task "$TASK" || {
  echo "⚠ fast.md log_to_state: quick-tasks-append failed — the verb's own reason is on the line above, and the quick task was NOT recorded. The commit already landed; record the task with: gsd_run quick-tasks-append --task \"$TASK\"" >&2
}
```
</step>

<step name="done">
Report completion:

```
✅ Done: {what was changed}
   Commit: {short hash}
   Files: {list of changed files}
```

No next-step suggestions. No workflow routing. Just done.
</step>

<guardrails>
- NEVER spawn a Task/subagent — this runs inline
- NEVER create PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md files
- NEVER run research or plan-checking
- If the task takes more than 3 file edits, STOP and redirect to /gsd:quick
- If you're unsure how to implement it, STOP and redirect to /gsd:quick
</guardrails>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Task completed in current context (no subagents)
- [ ] Atomic git commit with conventional message
- [ ] Quick task recorded as a fact by `quick-tasks-append` (its exit code is the answer)
- [ ] Total operation under 2 minutes wall time
</success_criteria>
