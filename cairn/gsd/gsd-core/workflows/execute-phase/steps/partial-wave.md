<step name="handle_partial_wave_execution">
If `WAVE_FILTER` was used, re-run plan discovery after execution:

```bash
CAIRN_GSD="${CAIRN_GSD:-}"; if [ ! -x "$CAIRN_GSD" ]; then _cg_try=""; for _cg_root in "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-}" "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)" "$PWD"; do [ -n "$_cg_root" ] || continue; _cg_try="$_cg_root/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh"; if [ -x "$_cg_try" ]; then CAIRN_GSD="$_cg_try"; break; fi; done; fi; if [ ! -x "${CAIRN_GSD:-}" ]; then echo "ERROR: cairn-gsd.sh not found (last path tried: ${_cg_try:-<none>}) - this workflow speaks to the cairn dispatcher that lives in the repo. Run it from inside the CairnGo checkout, or export CAIRN_GSD=<checkout>/cairn/scripts/cairn-gsd.sh" >&2; exit 1; fi; export CAIRN_GSD; gsd_run() { "$CAIRN_GSD" "$@"; }
POST_PLAN_INDEX=$(gsd_run query phase-plan-index "${PHASE_NUMBER}")
```

Apply the same "incomplete" filtering rules as earlier:
- ignore plans with `has_summary: true`
- if `--gaps-only`, only consider `gap_closure: true` plans

**If incomplete plans still remain anywhere in the phase:**
- STOP here
- Do NOT run phase verification
- Do NOT mark the phase complete in ROADMAP/STATE
- Present:

```markdown
## Wave {WAVE_FILTER} Complete

Selected wave finished successfully. This phase still has incomplete plans, so phase-level verification and completion were intentionally skipped.

/gsd:execute-phase {phase} ${GSD_WS}                # Continue remaining waves
/gsd:execute-phase {phase} --wave {next} ${GSD_WS}  # Run the next wave explicitly
```

**If no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes:**
- continue with the normal phase-level verification and completion flow below
- this means the selected wave happened to be the last remaining work in the phase
</step>
